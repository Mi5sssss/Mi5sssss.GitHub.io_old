# 一种基于无线技术的特定范围现场助听系统



# 一、项目社会价值

## 1.1 需求分析与项目目标

 

在大多数的场景下，具有听觉障碍的人听到的广播声音，需要通过扬声器传出，在空气中与室内噪声混杂以及环境的反射才能进入耳朵。在我们的系统中，可以将声音直接从源头传出并获取，直接传递到使用者耳中，减少了信号损失所带来的成本升高。此外，听力障碍者本身对于佩戴助听设备外出存在一定的心理负担，因为助听器会将他们与普通人群区分开来，而我们的产品让听力障碍者只需佩戴耳机即可收到声音信息，因此可以帮助缓解这一心理上的负担，并进一步减少听力障碍者在日常生活中的心理压力。

 

我们团队通过了解周边社会环境中真实存在的听力障碍人士的需求，查询相关资料和对比现有的助听方式，推出了我们这个项目的助听产品。

 

通过查阅资料显示，目前存在的听力障碍人群可以简单分为如下几类：天生听力障碍缺陷人群、嘈杂环境无法听清的听力障碍者、选择性听力障碍、后天不良因素导致的听力障碍等。目前主流解决听力障碍人群的听力问题方式是使用助听器。我们通过调查和走访得知，普通助听器只能适用于一对一的安静交谈，很难满足于嘈杂的环境中捕获信息。并且，主流的助听器限制很多，不仅是适用范围的问题，还有用起来的机理性问题。例如，助听器拥有精密零件，需要特别呵护，不然会导致助听器报废的问题。助听器还有声音失灵的问题，他只能保证听的到，但无法保证听得清。

 

助听器作为听障人士的生活必需品，但产量只能满足全球不到10%的需求。发达国家助听器约20%的市场渗透率，发展中国家,每40个需求者中只有不到一位拥有助听器。全国7000多万听障者中，70%应该佩戴助听器，即4900万人;其中10%的人验配助听器，暂按一只耳朵计算，需要490万台助听器;按每5年更新一次计算，则每年至少需要98万台。数据进一步显示，从发现听力障碍到最后选配助听器，平均等待时间约7到10年;从关键的佩戴率上来看，国内助听器选配比例在5%左右，发达国家助听器选配比率约25%，是国内的5倍。

 

以上数据显示，助听器并不能很好的满足听力障碍人士的需求。特别是有短暂性听力障碍或者特定听力障碍问题的人士，他们对助听器的需求不大，但是在公共场合的必要通知却不能错过。此时，我们的项目产品，一种特定范围站点中基于无线技术的聋人助听系统。听力障碍人士使用我们的APP同时仅需自己的耳机就可以轻易实现。

 

## 1.2 受益群体描述

## 1.3 预期成果

 

我们的产品是一种将讲话者的声音从麦克风直接发送到客户终端的系统。系统通过安装信号源，将音频从扩音系统直接传输到客户终端（供客户使用的手机APP，以及连接手机的耳机）。在使用过程中，将声音信号源通过电磁波频率的形式，传递到手机APP里面，转换成可输出的供失聪人士听到的声音，并将这种声音进一步传输到耳机。这种将原始声音信息直接传输到耳中的方式，有助于减少背景噪声对原始声音信息传输带来的损失。此外，使用我们的系统，可以取消传统的助听器设备佩戴，以耳机实现助听器的主要功能。在安装该系统设备的特定场所中，客户可以通过嵌入式设备或者打开终端中的设备客户端进行访问，减少佩戴传统助听器所带来的尴尬，同时能够聆听信号源声音。



 

# 二、项目创意与可行性

## 2.1 创意方案

 

本项目将设计一种将讲话者的声音从声音源头直接传输到声音接收者耳中的系统。该系统通过安装声音接收装置，将音频从讲话者口中直接传输到声音接收者耳中。具体实现方式为：在使用过程中，将声音信号通过电磁波频率的形式，传递到客户终端，即用户的手机APP，然后转换成可供失聪人士听到的声音，并将这种声音传输到声音接收者佩戴的耳机中。

 

一般而言，公共场所的广播声音通过扬声器传出后，会在空气中与环境噪声混杂后才进入耳朵。对于失聪人士而言，公共场所的大量噪声会对其获取所需声音信息造成较严重的干扰，因为其使用的助听设备所获取的声音信息是所处环境的全部声音，真正需要的广播等信息会因噪声而损失。与传统的助听设备相比，本项目的系统将原始声音信息直接处理后传输到失聪人士耳中，避免了失聪人士所处环境的背景噪声对原始声音信息传输带来的损失。这种系统可以有效地帮助失聪人士在较嘈杂的公共场所，如车站、机场等，接受他们需要的声音信息。

 

对于需要接受声音信息的失聪人士，使用适用于智能手机的耳机即可接收到讲话者的声音。因此，使用该系统，对于失聪人士而言，可以用耳机实现助听器的核心功能，避免佩戴助听器。由此，失聪人士因佩戴助听器造成的心理压力得以缓解。

 

本项目的系统的实现需要的技术基础较为简单，实现成本较低。对于声音信号的发出方，需要安装获取声音信号的设备，如麦克风。此外，需要安装能够无线传递电磁波的设备，例如蓝牙或无线网络。对于面积较小的公共场所，如家庭影院，可以安装小型的传输设备；对于机场等大面积的公共场所，可以安装大型的传输设备。对于声音的接收方，仅需接收终端能够支援Wi-Fi、蓝牙等无线传输协议，以及需要音频输出设备，如耳机。对于声音接收方使用的终端，即手机APP，需要具有将普通的声音信号处理成失聪人士可以接收的音频的功能，这种功能可以通过特定的程序实现。

 

此外，在本项目的系统中，作为用户终端的手机APP可以设置一些更便于使用的辅助功能。APP中需要有详细的使用指引，引导用户使用；通过用户定位，APP可以展示用户附近装有本系统的地点并提供地图导航，便于用户前往这些地点。

 

## 2.2. 可行性分析 

 

声音获取设备、声音接受设备、音频转换技术、商业营销及推广（市场细分、市场定位、竞争者分析）、预算及成本空值

 

本系统的使用使基于某一特定范围内的，如会议场所、公共交通场所、商场等。如果该产品计划广泛应用于公共场所，则需要相应的场景标识或提示来提醒听障人士：此处可以使用聋人助听系统。所以我们需要给予使用者清楚的提示，提升该系统的便捷性与服务性。

 

关于使用场景的提示，我们可以在公共场所使用类似于常见的公共设施标志来提醒听障人士；而在本系统中，由于声音的传输终端是智能手机，所以我们可以将使用场景的提示功能同样嵌入在只能手机的APP中。我们计划在产品中加入“站点地图”的功能，听障人士可以随时查看“站点地图”与自身定位，确认当前环境能否使用本系统的功能。

# 三、项目执行与进程 

 

## 3.1 核心产品或者服务开发

我们的产品是一种将讲话者的声音从麦克风直接发送到客户终端的系统。系统通过安装信号源，将音频从扩音系统直接传输到客户终端。本产品包含三个部分：用于安装至手机的客户端，用于部署至公共场所的服务设施与部署至公共场所的服务设施可以接入现有的广播系统，可穿戴接受设备。并借助蓝牙，无线网络（Wi-Fi）等无线通信技术，根据使用者的位置，为使用者下发导览与帮助资料。在使用过程中，将声音信号源通过电磁波频率的形式，传递到手机客户端钟，转换成可输出的供失聪人士听到的声音，并将这种声音进一步传输到耳机。这种将原始声音信息直接传输到耳中的方式，有助于减少背景噪声对原始声音信息传输带来的损失。此外，使用我们的系统，可以取消掉传统的助听器设备佩戴，以耳机实现助听器的主要功能。在安装该系统设备的特定场所中，客户可以通过嵌入式设备或者打开终端中的设备客户端进行访问，减少佩戴传统助听器所带来的尴尬，同时能够聆听信号源声音。

 

安装至手机的客户端通过将传统助听器的声音放大功能和耳机功能合二为一，当听力或障碍人士进入大型场所时，通过服务设施下发的数据自动连接至场所提供的助听网络，并通过该网络为耳机佩戴者提供低延迟，可定制的声音放大服务与语音导览服务。

 

在大多数的场景下，具有听觉障碍的人听到的广播声音，需要通过扬声器传出，在空气中与室内噪声混杂以及环境的反射才能进入耳朵。在我们的系统中，可以将声音直接从源头传出并获取，直接传递到使用者耳中，减少了信号损失所带来的成本升高。此外，听力障碍者本身对于佩戴助听设备外出存在一定的心理负担，因为助听器会将他们与普通人群区分开来，而我们的产品让听力障碍者只需佩戴耳机即可收到声音信息，因此可以帮助缓解这一心理上的负担，并进一步减少听力障碍者在日常生活中的心理压力。



## 3.2 项目的资金来源

由于本项目的主要面向对象为残障人士，因此，我们认为本项目除设备费用外，原则上不应向残障人士收入服务的订阅费用，而相关的服务费用应该有安装本系统的公共机构承担。基于本项目的公共利益和应用于公共场所的潜力，若能成功推广，相信此类服务能够获得公共场所如会堂，车站，大学等机构的采购。相关的采购费用和后期的维护费用，将足以维持项目的运作。

  

可持续运营的资金来源主要包括为场所部署系统的服务费用和后期的系统维护费用。随着时间的推移，如果本项目的实施方案使用人数达到一定的基数，并得到了主流系统开发商人认可，并将本系统中的“手机应用”部分并入系统内置组建，则可最终达至可持续运营。

 

## 3.3 项目传播与推广策略

传播渠道包括与政府合作，将该服务转化成为一种公共服务。同时，我们也可以于障碍人士协会，相关线上社区和帮助障碍人士的义工中进行定向推广。具体的推广方案包括通过义工推荐，在已经安装设备的公共场所内设立标识。



若本项目能够最终被移动设备系统开发商收购，而成为其内置功能，相信从此之后，本项目将不再会有推广上的困扰。



# 四、项目风险及预案

根据本系统的原理，使用智能手机app接受特定的无线电波信号并将其转换为电信号，并最终经过耳机或受话器转换成听障人士可听到的声音信号。而在无限电波传输的过程中，不能排除有其他相同频率的电磁波对其进行干扰。此外，从非听障人士的角度考虑，这种特定环境中持续的无线电波信号也可能会影响他们正常使用电子设备。

 

综上，我们可以在项目发展较为成熟，并且有一定用户基数的情况下，向政府机构或者有关部门申请特定频道范围的广播信号，专供使用本系统功能的听障人士使用，不与其他频道的信号产生干扰。确保听障人士用户体验，以及避免影响其他电子设备的正常使用。





# A wireless technology-based field hearing aid system for a specific range

# I. Social value of the project
## 1.1 Demand Analysis and Project Objectives


In most scenarios, people with hearing impairment hear radio sounds that need to be transmitted through speakers and mixed with room noise in the air and reflections from the environment to get to the ear. In our system, the sound can be transmitted and acquired directly from the source and delivered directly to the user's ear, reducing the elevated cost associated with signal loss. In addition, the hearing impaired themselves have a psychological burden of wearing hearing aids out and about, as hearing aids can distinguish them from the general population. Our product allows the hearing impaired to receive sound information by simply wearing headphones, thus helping to alleviate this psychological burden and further reducing the psychological stress of the hearing impaired in their daily lives.

 

Our team launched our hearing aid product for this project by understanding the needs of real people with hearing impairment in the surrounding social environment, consulting relevant information and comparing existing hearing aid methods.

 

By consulting the information, the existing hearing impaired people can be simply divided into the following categories: people who are born with hearing impairment defects, those who cannot hear in noisy environment, selective hearing impairment, hearing impairment caused by acquired adverse factors, etc. At present, the mainstream way to solve the hearing problems of people with hearing impairment is to use hearing aids. We have learned through surveys and visits that ordinary hearing aids can only be used for one-to-one quiet conversations and are difficult to meet in noisy environments to capture information. Moreover, mainstream hearing aids have many limitations, not only in terms of their applicability, but also in terms of the mechanics of their use. For example, hearing aids have precision parts that require special care or they can become obsolete. Hearing aids also have the problem of sound failure, as they can only guarantee hearing, but not clarity.

 

Hearing aids are a necessity for the hearing impaired, but the production can only meet less than 10% of the global demand. The market penetration rate of hearing aids in developed countries is about 20%, while in developing countries, less than one out of every 40 people in need has a hearing aid. Of the 70 million hearing impaired people in China, 70% should wear hearing aids, i.e. 49 million people; 10% of them should be fitted with hearing aids, which means 4.9 million hearing aids are needed for one ear for the time being; and at least 980,000 hearing aids are needed every year, based on the calculation of renewal every 5 years. The data further shows that the average waiting time from the discovery of hearing impairment to the final selection of hearing aids is about 7 to 10 years; in terms of the key wearing rate, the proportion of hearing aid selection in China is about 5%, while the proportion of hearing aid selection in developed countries is about 25%, which is 5 times higher than that in China.

 

The above data shows that hearing aids are not good enough to meet the needs of people with hearing impairment. Especially for people with transient hearing impairment or specific hearing impairment problems, they have little need for hearing aids, but cannot miss the necessary notice in public places. At this point, our project product, a wireless technology based hearing aid system for the deaf in a specific range of sites. Hearing impaired people can easily use our app while only needing their own headphones.

 

## 1.2 Beneficiary Group Description


Deaf people, hearing impaired people

 

## 1.3 Expected results


Our product is a system that sends the speaker's voice directly from the microphone to the customer's terminal. The system transmits audio directly from the PA system to the customer terminal (cell phone app for customer use, and headphones connected to the phone) by installing a signal source. In the process of use, the sound signal source is transmitted to the cell phone APP in the form of electromagnetic wave frequencies, converted into an outputtable sound for deaf people to hear, and this sound is further transmitted to the headphones. This direct transmission of the original sound information to the ear helps to reduce the loss of the original sound information transmission caused by background noise. In addition, with our system, it is possible to eliminate the need to wear a traditional hearing aid device and perform the primary function of a hearing aid with headphones. In the particular place where the system device is installed, the customer can access it through the embedded device or by opening the device client in the terminal, reducing the embarrassment caused by wearing traditional hearing aids while being able to listen to the source sound.

 

# II. Project Idea and Feasibility
## 2.1 Creative Solution


This project will design a system that transmits the speaker's voice from the source directly to the ear of the receiver of the voice. The system transmits audio directly from the speaker's mouth to the sound receiver's ear by installing a sound receiving device. This is achieved by transmitting the sound signal in the form of electromagnetic wave frequencies to the customer terminal, i.e., the user's cell phone app, and then converting it into a sound that can be heard by a deaf person, and transmitting this sound to the earphones worn by the sound receiver.

 

Generally speaking, the broadcast sound in public places is transmitted through speakers and then mixed with ambient noise in the air before entering the ear. For deaf people, the large amount of noise in public places can cause more serious interference with their access to the required sound information, because the sound information acquired by the hearing aid they use is the entire sound of the environment they are in, and the information they really need, such as the broadcast, is lost due to the noise. Compared with conventional hearing aids, the system in this project transmits the original sound information directly to the deaf person's ear after processing, avoiding the loss of original sound information transmission caused by the background noise of the environment the deaf person is in. This system can effectively help deaf people to receive the sound information they need in noisy public places, such as stations and airports.

 

For deaf people who need to receive sound information, the speaker's voice can be received using a headset suitable for smartphones. Therefore, with this system, deaf people can use headphones to perform the core functions of hearing aids and avoid wearing hearing aids. As a result, the psychological stress caused by wearing hearing aids is relieved for the deaf.

 

The technical basis for the implementation of the system is relatively simple and inexpensive. For the emitter of the sound signal, a device for acquiring the sound signal, such as a microphone, needs to be installed. In addition, devices that can transmit electromagnetic waves wirelessly, such as Bluetooth or wireless networks, need to be installed. For public places with small areas, such as home theaters, small transmission devices can be installed; for public places with large areas, such as airports, large transmission devices can be installed. For the receiver of sound, only the receiving terminal needs to be able to support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other wireless transmission protocols, as well as the need for audio output devices, such as headphones. For the terminal used by the sound receiver, i.e., the cell phone APP, it needs to have the function of processing ordinary sound signals into audio that can be received by deaf people, and this function can be realized by a specific program.

 

In addition, in this project, the cell phone APP as the user terminal can be set up with some more user-friendly auxiliary functions; the APP needs to have detailed usage guidelines to guide the user; through user positioning, the APP can show the locations near the user where the system is installed and provide map navigation to facilitate the user's access to these locations.

 

## 2.2. Feasibility Analysis 


Sound acquisition equipment, sound reception equipment, audio conversion technology, commercial marketing and promotion (market segmentation, market positioning, competitor analysis), budget and cost null

 

The use of this system is based on a specific scope, such as meeting places, public transportation places, shopping malls, etc. If the product is planned to be widely used in public places, it needs to be marked with appropriate scenes or reminders to remind the hearing impaired that the hearing aid system for the deaf is available here. Therefore, we need to give users a clear indication to enhance the convenience and serviceability of the system.

 

As for the hints of the usage scenes, we can use the similar signs of common public facilities in public places to remind the hearing impaired; and in this system, since the sound transmission terminal is a smartphone, we can embed the hints of the usage scenes in the APP of the cell phone only. We plan to add the function of "site map" to the product, so that the hearing impaired can check the "site map" and their own positioning at any time to confirm whether the current environment can use the functions of the system.

# III. Project Implementation and Process 

## 3.1 Core product or service development
Our product is a system that sends the speaker's voice directly from the microphone to the client's terminal. The system transmits audio directly from the PA system to the client terminal by installing a signal source. The product consists of three parts: a client for installation to cell phones, a service facility for deployment to public places and a service facility for deployment to public places that can be connected to existing broadcasting systems, and wearable receiving devices. With the help of wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, the product can provide users with guided tours and help information based on their location. In the process of use, the sound signal source is transmitted to the cell phone client clock in the form of electromagnetic wave frequencies, converted into an outputtable sound for deaf people to hear, and this sound is further transmitted to the headphones. This direct transmission of the original sound information to the ear helps reduce the loss of the original sound information transmission caused by background noise. In addition, with our system, it is possible to eliminate the need to wear a traditional hearing aid device and perform the primary function of a hearing aid with headphones. In the specific location where the system is installed, the customer can access the device via the embedded device or by opening the device client in the terminal, reducing the embarrassment of wearing a traditional hearing aid while being able to listen to the source sound.

 

By combining the sound amplification function of traditional hearing aids with the headset function, the client installed on the cell phone automatically connects to the hearing aid network provided by the venue through the data sent by the service facility when a hearing or impaired person enters a large venue, and provides low-latency, customizable sound amplification and voice guidance services to the headset wearer through the network.

 

In most scenarios, people with hearing impairments hear broadcast sounds that need to be transmitted through speakers and mixed with room noise in the air and reflections from the environment to reach their ears. In our system, the sound can be transmitted and acquired directly from the source and delivered directly to the user's ear, reducing the elevated cost associated with signal loss. In addition, the hearing impaired themselves have a psychological burden of wearing hearing aids out and about, as hearing aids can distinguish them from the general population. Our product allows the hearing impaired to receive sound information by simply wearing headphones, thus helping to alleviate this psychological burden and further reducing the psychological stress of the hearing impaired in their daily lives.

## 3.2 Funding of the project
Since the main target audience of this project is people with disabilities, we believe that this project should not, in principle, generate subscription fees for the service from people with disabilities, except for the cost of the equipment, and the related service costs should be borne by the public institution that installed this system. Based on the public interest of this project and its potential application in public places, if successfully promoted, we believe that such services can be procured by public places such as halls, stations, universities, etc. The associated procurement costs and maintenance costs will be sufficient to sustain the operation of the project.

  

The funding source for sustainable operation mainly includes the service cost of deploying the system for the venue and the maintenance cost of the system at a later stage. Over time, if the number of users of the project reaches a certain base, and the mainstream system developers approve the project, and the "mobile application" part of the system is incorporated into the system, the project will eventually reach sustainable operation.

 

## 3.3 Project communication and promotion strategy
Dissemination channels include cooperation with the government to turn the service into a public service. We can also promote the service to associations of people with disabilities, related online communities and volunteers who help people with disabilities. The specific promotion plan includes signage in public places where the devices have been installed through volunteer referrals.

If the project is eventually acquired by mobile device system developers and becomes a built-in feature, it is believed that there will be no more promotion problems for the project.

# IV. Project risks and plans
According to the principle of this system, the smartphone app accepts a specific radio wave signal and converts it into an electrical signal, which is eventually converted into a sound signal that can be heard by the hearing-impaired through headphones or receivers. And in the process of infinite radio wave transmission, interference from other electromagnetic waves of the same frequency cannot be excluded. In addition, from the perspective of non-hearing-impaired people, the continuous radio wave signal in this specific environment may also affect their normal use of electronic devices.

 

To sum up, we can apply to government agencies or relevant departments for a specific channel range of radio signals exclusively for the hearing impaired who use this system function without interfering with other channels' signals when the project is more maturely developed and has a certain user base. To ensure the user experience of the hearing-impaired and to avoid affecting the normal use of other electronic devices.
