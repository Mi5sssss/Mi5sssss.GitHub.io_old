# Rui Xie  

I am currently a senior student from [<u>School of Microelectronics</u>]( https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in [<u>Southern University of Science and Technology</u>]( https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), expected obtain the baccalaureate in June 2022. I show great interests in EDA (Electronic design automation), Neuromorphic Computing, VLSI Design and Computer Architecture. My undergraduate supervisor is [<u>Dr. Quan Chen</u>]( https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/chenq3/en/).

<!-- I will start my PhD journey in  [<u>the University of Hong Kong</u>]( https://www.hku.hk/) under the supervision of [<u>Prof. Ngai Wong</u>]( https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/). -->

Here is <u>[My CV](doc/xie_cv.pdf)</u> by November 2021 and <u>[Google Scholar]( https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kFFMzkQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en)</u>.

**My current work**

The acceleration of large Memristor Crossbar Arrays (MCAs) is important for the SPICE of crossbar structure. We have built a preconditioner for the existing architecture through Modified Nodal Analysis Equations.

Also we have built a simulator including Noise (Pink, RTN) and nonlinearity of memristor for basic train networks.

Here is MNIST as input.

We want to make Look up tables for the real memristor which would help to facilitate our simulator.

My ultimate goal and current plan.
