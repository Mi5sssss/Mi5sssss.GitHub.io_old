# Research Interest
## EDA Circuit Simulation

**Steady-State Memristor Crossbar Array (MCA) Circuit Simulation:**

1. Exploited the structural regularity of MCAs to develop a specially-crafted preconditioner;
2. Designed the process of inverse and application to vectors that can be effciently evaluated by Kronecker product and
    block matrix inversion formula;
3. Experimentalized the numerical test of the specific band matrices;
4. Obtain a Fund of 10,000 CHY and won the third prize of 2021 School of Microelectronics Innovation Competition.

**Surrogate Modeling of Electro-Thermal Simulation:**

1. Used Ansys Icepak to modeling and simulate the process of SiC sandwich devices;
2. Designed the surrogate nueral network model through Python programming.

**RRAM (Resistive RAM) Non-Ideal Simulation:**

1. Design the multiply-add method of specific RRAM through open source RRAM simulation tool CROSSSIM from Sandia National Lab;
2. Develop the reading and writing control of simulation by amended model of Gaussian White Noise model.
